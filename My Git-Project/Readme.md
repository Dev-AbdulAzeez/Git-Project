## ***Initializing a Git repository***

### After the installation of `Git` on the computer, the next step goes thus:

#### I opened a terminal on the computer, in my own case MacBook

**My working directory is named SAMPLE**
1. Create a working folder or directory using the command `mkdir Sample`
2. Change or move into the working directory using `cd Sample`
3. Inside the folder, run `git init` to initialize the local repo.

## **Making my first Commit**

### These steps were followed in creating my `first commit`:

1. Inside the working directory, a file named `index.html` was created using command `torch index.html`
2. I used `nano` command to insert some text into the `index.html`, and it was saved using `:qw!`
3. The changes were added to the `git` staging area with the command `git add .`
To commit ,use the command `git commit -m "here is my new file"`
